      "name": "Mango",

      "scientificName": "Mangifera indica",

      "Description": "The mango tree (Mangifera indica), a crown jewel of the Anacardiaceae family, stands tall and proud, its origins tracing back to South Asia. This evergreen giant, reaching heights of 15-30 meters (50-100 feet), boasts a lifespan that can stretch for centuries, some specimens even exceeding 400 years. With a thick and sturdy trunk, often exceeding 3.7 meters (12 feet) in circumference, the mango tree is a picture of resilience. Its bark, rough and grayish-brown,becomes increasingly furrowed with age, telling the story of its long life. Adorning the branches are simple, lanceolate-shaped leaves. These evergreen beauties range from 5-16 inches (12.5-40.5 centimeters) long and 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5 centimeters) wide. Their dark green surface shines brightly, contrasting with the slightly lighter green or yellowish-green underside. Delicate veins run through the leaves, creating a characteristic wrinkled appearance. Young mango leaves unveil a captivating blend of reddish-purple and green, gradually transforming into a uniform green as they mature. From the tips of these branches emerge fragrant clusters of small white or yellowish-white flowers. Primarily pollinated by insects, though some self-pollination occurs, these blooms typically grace the tree in early spring, before the leaves emerge. This spectacular floral display precedes the arrival of the much-anticipated fruit. The mango, a single-seeded drupe, boasts a fleshy, juicy interior and a smooth or wrinkled skin that can be green, yellow, orange, or red when ripe, depending on the variety. The size of these delicious fruits also varies greatly, ranging from small and round to large and oblong, offering a diverse array of flavor and texture.Beyond their culinary appeal, mango leaves hold cultural and medicinal significance. Their antiseptic and antifungal properties have been utilized in various traditional practices, while young leaves sometimes find their way into salads or cooked dishes. Dried mango leaves, imbued with symbolism and fragrance, are used in religious ceremonies and as incense in certain regions. The mango tree, with its majestic presence, delicious fruit, and diverse uses, truly embodies a symbol of tropical beauty and bounty.",

      "Cultivation" : "The macadamias grown commercially are principally of two species, the smooth-shelled Macadamia integrifolia and the rough-shelled M. tetraphylla; the two tend to hybridize beyond distinction. A third species, M. ternifolia, is sometimes cultivated, while the final member of the genus, the bulberin nut (M. jansenii), is an endangered species. Because macadamias are difficult to propagate, slow to bear, and limited in range of cultivability, production has not kept pace with increased demand, thus rendering the product costly. Most commercial production takes place in their native Australia and in Hawaii. However, given the successes of the Hawaiian macadamia industry, other subtropical regions have planted orchards, and there are large acreages of macadamias in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi and in parts of South and Central America. As an orchard crop, the macadamia needs rich well-drained soil and 130 cm (50 inches) of rain annually. It is difficult to tell precisely when the nuts are ripe, so the macadamias are not usually harvested until they drop to the ground. The mature fruits are then gathered by hand, machine-hulled, dried, and stored for processing.",
